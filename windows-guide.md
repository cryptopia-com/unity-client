## Playing the Game

### Downloading and Extracting Game Files

**Downloading the Zip File**
Download the [Zip File](hhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1KlXwK34CXcfej_6n6q-7ZX94s_JakG65/view?usp=sharing). The game file is compressed in ZIP format to save space.

Google Drive may require confirmation due to virus scanning limitations. Continue by clicking `Download anyway`.

**Extracting Game Files**

1. Set and Locate the Downloaded File: Once the download is complete, navigate to the folder on your computer where the file was saved (typically the "Downloads" folder).

2. Extract the Zip File: Right-click the downloaded file and choose "Extract Here" from the menu. This action will unzip the contents of the file into a new folder. If there is no option to open, you can use any extraction/zipping software like [7-Zip] or [WinRAR].

## Clearing Local Data

This is necessary after game updates to clear local data. The user will receive a prompt if this is required.

If this message is displayed, follow the steps below to update the client.

**Navigating to Your Local Data**

To navigate to your local app data, press `Windows` key + `R` key on your keyboard to open the Run window. Type **'%AppData%\..\LocalLow'** to go directly to your LocalLow folder.

**Deleting Local Data**

Select all items in the folder and delete them. Make sure the game is not running when deleting the files as they are used by the game and will not be removed. You can now start playing the game again and create a new account. This will prevent prompts for updates and clear cached local data.
