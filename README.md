Locate the Downloaded File: Once the download is complete, navigate to the folder on your computer where the file was saved (typically the "Downloads" folder).

Extract the Zip File: Right-click on the downloaded zip file and select "Extract" or "Extract Here" from the menu. This action will unzip the contents of the file into a new folder.

**Step 3: Explore the Game Files**

Open the Extracted Folder: After extraction, open the new folder that contains the unzipped game files.

Look for the Game Application: Within the extracted folder, search for the game's executable file (often ending with .exe for Windows or .app for macOS). This file is what you'll use to launch the game.

**Creating Your Local Account:** Once you've selected the correct word, proceed to create your local account by setting a **5-digit PIN**. This PIN will be used to log in to your account after each gaming session. You will be asked to re-enter the PIN for verification.

### Gas Mining Strategy Setting
Gas Mining strategy is how your account fuels itself for future transactions. Be it, changing appearance, moving or minting resources; gas is needed for it to be mined in the blockchain.

![Pin Code Secured](https://i.ibb.co/hVXvDwC/Steps-004.png)

**Setting Gas Strategy for Your Account:** After securing your local account, we can continue by configuring the gas mining strategy for your local machine.

![Pin Code Secured](https://i.ibb.co/wJr4gcv/Steps-005.png)

**Gas Mining Test and Strategy:** In the SKALE network, Cryptopia offers gas mining. Click 'Go' to observe mining speed with selected cores and choose a gas strategy:

Because we are in the **SKALE network**, Cryptopia has an option to fully utilize gas mining in the client. Press 'Go' to see how fast the mining is with the cores selected.

**Gas Mining Test:** Tests mining speed using multithreading and the built-in miner to recommend a gas strategy.

**Gas Strategy Options:** Choose from **Balance First**, **Never Mine**, or **Always Mine** for transaction payments.

* **Balance First:** Uses stored gas in your wallet first; if insufficient, it uses the built-in miner.
* **Never Mine:** Always requests gas to be added to your gas wallet.
* **Always Mine:** Uses the built-in miner and never asks for gas to be added to the wallet.

![Pin Code Secured](https://i.ibb.co/0MqpV3g/Steps-006.png)

**Analyzing Mining Speed:** While the mining speed test is running, the kilohash speed will be displayed and analyzed to recommend an optimal strategy.

## Gameplay

### About the project
Cryptopia is a strategic Web3 gameverse with RPG elements, based entirely on the blockchain. The gameplay combines elements of strategic games, including exploration, expansion, and exploitation. Players have the option to choose from four distinct gameplay styles: being a Tycoon, an Adventurer, a Pirate, or a Bounty Hunter.

### Playing Cryptopia
At the heart of Cryptopia lies the choice. Players have the liberty to align with one of the four core Factions: Traditional, Eco, Tech, and Industrial. But that's not all! Dive deeper, and you'll discover the two intriguing sub-factions: Pirates and Bounty Hunters, bringing in a PvP dynamic.

Cryptopia offers players four main gameplay modes:

**Tycoon**: Here, players can invest in virtual properties using Title Deeds, expand their business empire, and provide job opportunities to others.

**Adventure**: Operating freely, Adventurers traverse Cryptopia, undertaking quests to earn rewards like Cryptopia Tokens (TOS) and experience points.

**Pirates**: Based on Treasure Island, Pirates can loot other players and run a secret black market with rare resources.

**Bounty Hunters**: They counteract the Pirates, aiming to retrieve stolen items and maintain peace in Cryptopia.

### Game World
Cryptopia is a strategic Web3 gameverse with RPG elements, based entirely on the blockchain. The gameplay combines elements of strategic games, including exploration, expansion, and exploitation. Players have the option to choose from two main gameplay styles: being a Tycoon or an Adventurer.

As a Tycoon, participants can build a DeFi empire. This entails owning land, constructing buildings, initiating businesses, and profiting from sales. On the other hand, choosing the Adventurer path allows players to embark on quests, build their careers, level up, achieve the Grandmaster level, and craft unique items.

Players can also craft NFT items, and the more resources they amass, the more superior NFTs they can create. Companions or pets can be owned as well to enhance player stats and to engage in Arena battles. Furthermore, upgrading NFT collections leads to enhanced benefits for characters.

Cryptopia also ensures inclusivity; players can earn without obtaining NFTs. Being free to play, it welcomes everyone to experience its offerings.
