## Playing the Game

### Downloading and Extracting Game Files

**Downloading the Zip File**
Download the [Zip File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PA8K6f-gDuaFd6Kt8ujiCsjxlKPoSEUs/view?usp=sharing). The game file is compressed in ZIP format to save space.

![Downloading](https://i.ibb.co/pdRpDZj/1-drive-link.png)

Google Drive may require confirmation due to virus scanning limitations. Continue by clicking `Download anyway`.

**Extracting Game Files**

1. Locate the Downloaded File: Navigate to the folder on your computer where the file was saved (typically the "Downloads" folder).

Once extracted, click inside the folder to explore its contents.

2. Navigate to `General` Tab:
   - In the `Security & Privacy` window, click on the `General` tab.

3. Override Security Settings:

   - Next to this message, you'll find an option labeled `Open Anyway`. Click on this option to proceed.

B. **Control-Clicking and Opening**

1. Control-Click (or Right-Click) the 'Mac Build':
   - Select the `Open` option from the context menu.
   
2. New Warning Options:
   - You should now have an `Open` option that bypasses the security settings.

## Clearing Local Data

This is necessary after game updates to clear local data. The user will receive a prompt if this is required.

**Navigating to Your Local Data**
Three Possible Locations:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Cryptopia/Cryptopia`
- `~/Library/Caches`
- `~/Library/Application Support/com.Cryptopia.Cryptopia`

Open the folder that contains the files on the screenshot, depending on your macOS version.

**Deleting Files**

Select all items in the folder and move them to the trash. You can now start playing the game again and create a new account without prompts to update or delete cached local data.
