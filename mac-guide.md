## Playing the Game

### Downloading and Extracting Game Files

**Downloading the Zip File**
Download the [Zip File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PA8K6f-gDuaFd6Kt8ujiCsjxlKPoSEUs/view?usp=sharing). The game file is compressed in ZIP format to save space.

![Downloading](https://i.ibb.co/pdRpDZj/1-drive-link.png)

Google Drive may require confirmation due to virus scanning limitations. Continue by clicking `Download anyway`.

**Extracting Game Files**

2. Extract the Zip File: Right-click (or Control-Click) the downloaded file and choose "Open" or "Extract Here" from the menu. Alternatively, use extraction software like [7-Zip] or [WinRAR].

## Clearing Local Data

This is necessary after game updates to clear local data. The user will receive a prompt if this is required.

**Navigating to Your Local Data**
Three Possible Locations:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Cryptopia/Cryptopia`
- `~/Library/Caches`
- `~/Library/Application Support/com.Cryptopia.Cryptopia`

![Local Data](https://i.ibb.co/HX1TWTd/11-Folder.png)

Open the folder that contains the mentioned files, depending on your macOS version.

**Deleting Files**
![Delete Files](https://i.ibb.co/jMJ2BLG/12-Move-To-Trash.png)

Select all items in the folder and move them to the trash. You can now start playing the game again and create a new account without prompts to update or delete cached local data.
